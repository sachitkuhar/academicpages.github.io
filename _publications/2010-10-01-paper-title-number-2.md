Deep learning accelerators have emerged to enable energy-efficient and high-throughput inference from edge devices such as self-driving cars and smartphones, to data centers for batch inference such as recommendation systems. However, the actual energy efficiency and throughput of a deep learning accelerator depends on the deep neural network (DNN) loop nest mapping on the processing element array of an accelerator. Moreover, the efficiency of a mapping dramatically changes by the target DNN layer dimensions and available hardware resources. Therefore, the optimal mapping search problem is a non-trivial high-dimensional optimization problem. Although several tools and frameworks exist for compiling to CPUs and GPUs, we lack similar tools for deep learning accelerators.

To deal with the optimized mapping search problem in deep learning accelerators, we propose mRNA (mapper for reconfigurable neural accelerators), which automatically searches optimal mappings using heuristics based on domain knowledge about deep learning and an energy/runtime cost evaluation framework. mRNA targets MAERI, a recently proposed opensource deep learning accelerator that provides flexibility via reconfigurable interconnects, to run the unique mappings for each layer generated by mRNA. In realistic machine learning workloads from MLPerf, the optimal mappings identified by mRNA framework provides 15% to 26% lower runtime and 55% to 64% lower energy for convolutional layers and 24% to 67% lower runtime and maximum 67% lower energy for fully connected layers compared to simple reference mappings manually picked for each layer.-->
