Hello there! I am a second-year Master’s student at [Georgia Institute of Technology's](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) School of Computer Science and did my undergraduate from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/).

<!--- I’ve been fortunate to have been advised by brilliant mentors past and present, among them [Prof. Tushar Krishna](https://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, [Prof. Christopher Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/) at UIUC and [Prof. Ribhu](https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/) at IIT-Guwahati. I’m grateful to them for their advice and support through the years. --->

<!-- Previously, I spent four amazing years at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) where I obtained my bachelor's degree in ECE. 
 -->
 I am currently working with [Prof. Danfei Xu](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~danfei/). During my undergrad, I was advised by [Prof. Tushar Krishna](https://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, [Prof. Christopher Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/) at UIUC and [Prof. Ribhu](https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/) at IIT-Guwahati. 
 
 I’ve been fortunate to have collaborated with [Dr. Christopher Hughes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DH-T2h46j_oC&hl=en) at Intel AI Labs, [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/) and [Prof. Judy Hoffman](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/) at Georgia Tech, and with people at Facebook AI Research and AWS AI Labs.
