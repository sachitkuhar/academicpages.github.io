I am a first-year Computer Science graduate student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/).

I’ve been fortunate to have been advised by brilliant mentors past and present, among them [Prof. Tushar Krishna](https://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, [Prof. Christopher Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/) at UIUC and [Prof. Ribhu](https://ribhuiitg.wordpress.com/) at IIT-Guwahati. I’m grateful to them for their advice and support through the years.

Previously, I spent four amazing years at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/) where I obtained my bachelor's degree in ECE.
